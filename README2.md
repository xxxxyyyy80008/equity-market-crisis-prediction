![Market Crisis Prediction](1766072659.jpg?ar=landscape)

## 📋 Abstract
This project implements **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)** to predict equity market crisis regimes. By analyzing historical market data and technical indicators, the model classifies market conditions into stable or crisis regimes, aiding in risk management and algorithmic trading strategies.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Regime Classification:** Binary/Multi-class classification of market states (e.g., Bull, Bear, Crisis).
*   **Advanced Modeling:** Utilizes GBDT implementations (XGBoost/LightGBM) for high-performance tabular data analysis.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Includes volatility indices, moving averages, and momentum indicators.
*   **Robust Evaluation:** Backtesting framework with precision-recall analysis for rare "crisis" events.
